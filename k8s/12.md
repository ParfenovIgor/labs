## Theory questions

* `StatefulSet` --- is an instrument for managing deployment and scaling of applications with states. The answer of every pod depends only on input query. Example of usage --- disributed system, where every pods are equal and don't store something shared.

* `Headless Service` --- disables load balancing and service IP, which is provided by default by Kubernetes. Example of usage --- implementation these features by ourselves, instead of existing ones.

* `Persistent Volumes` --- is an instrument for storing data independently of pods. Example of usage --- pods working with data sometimes, and are disabled in rest of time.
